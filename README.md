- FastDL path / Output path: The full path to the root of your FastDL directory (this directory must contain a folder called "maps")
- Map prefix(es): Filter which maps you want compiled by typing the common prefix (ex. "bhop_" or "de_"). Supports multiple prefixes (separate with '/' ex. "bhop_/kz_")
- Pre-check: Validates your paths and tells you how many maps were found with used prefix.
- Start: Start compressing the maps and put the compressed files in given FastDL path.
